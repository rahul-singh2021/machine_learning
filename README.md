# 1:linear regression 

This repository contains code for predicting home prices based on the area of the house using linear regression. It utilizes the `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` libraries in Python.

## Dataset

The `homeprices.csv` file contains the dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model. It consists of two columns: "area" (the area of the house in square feet) and "price" (the corresponding price of the house in dollars).

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rahul-singh21/machine_learning.git

## homeprices.csv
    area,price
    2600,550000
    3000,565000
    3200,610000
    3600,680000
    4000,725000    
    

## Results

The script performs the following steps:

1. Loads the dataset from the `homeprices.csv` file.
2. Visualizes the data using a scatter plot.
3. Trains a linear regression model on the data

Copy code
import numpy as np
from gradient_descent import gradient_descent

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11, 13])

gradient_descent(x, y)
The function will print the updated values of w (slope), b (y-intercept), and the current iteration number during the optimization process.

Parameters
The gradient_descent function has the following parameters:

x (NumPy array): Input data points (independent variable).
y (NumPy array): Output data points (dependent variable).
iterations (int): Number of iterations for the optimization process (default: 1000).
alpha (float): Learning rate for gradient descent (default: 0.001).
Feel free to modify the default values of iterations and alpha as per your requirements.

# 2:Linear Regression Multivariate
This program demonstrates multivariate linear regression using the scikit-learn library in Python. It predicts home prices based on the area, number of bedrooms, and age of the property. The dataset used for training and prediction is loaded from a CSV file named "homeprices.csv."
## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
- Ensure that the "homeprices.csv" file is in the same directory as the script.
- Modify the script if necessary to adapt to your dataset or analysis requirements.
- Run the script to perform multivariate linear regression and obtain price predictions.

## homeprices.csv
    area,bedrooms,age,price
    2600,3,20,550000
    3000,4,15,565000
    3200,,18,610000
    3600,3,30,595000
    4000,5,8,760000
    4100,6,8,810000


# 3:Gradient Descent 

This is an implementation of the gradient descent algorithm using numpy. It calculates the best-fit line for a given set of input data points.

## Usage

The `gradient_descent` function takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, representing the input data points and their corresponding target values.
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(x, y):
    # Function code here

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11, 13])

gradient_descent(x, y)

# 7:Logistic Regression with Newton Method

This program demonstrates logistic regression using the Newton method for parameter estimation. It generates a dataset and fits a logistic regression model using the Newton-Raphson algorithm to estimate the coefficients.

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to showcase the implementation of logistic regression with the Newton method. Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The Newton method is an iterative optimization algorithm used to estimate the parameters of the logistic regression model.
