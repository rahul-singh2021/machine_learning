# machine_learning

Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, algorithms, and resources to help you learn and implement various techniques in the field of machine learning.


Introduction
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of machine learning projects and resources to assist both beginners and experienced practitioners in learning and applying machine learning techniques.


Algorithms
The algorithms directory contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms. These implementations are provided as code snippets, Jupyter notebooks, or Python scripts, depending on the complexity and requirements of each algorithm. You can find implementations of popular algorithms such as:

Data Sets
To facilitate the learning and experimentation process, we have included a collection of sample data sets in the data-sets directory. These data sets cover various domains and can be used for training, testing, and evaluating machine learning models. Each data set is accompanied by a README file providing details about the data, its format, and potential applications.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository! If you would like to contribute your own machine learning projects, algorithms, or data sets, please follow the guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file. We appreciate your contributions and the opportunity to learn from each other.


# 1:linear regression 

This repository contains code for predicting home prices based on the area of the house using linear regression. It utilizes the `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` libraries in Python.

## Dataset

The `homeprices.csv` file contains the dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model. It consists of two columns: "area" (the area of the house in square feet) and "price" (the corresponding price of the house in dollars).

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rahul-singh21/machine_learning.git

## homeprices.csv
    area,price
    2600,550000
    3000,565000
    3200,610000
    3600,680000
    4000,725000    
    

## Results

The script performs the following steps:

1. Loads the dataset from the `homeprices.csv` file.
2. Visualizes the data using a scatter plot.
3. Trains a linear regression model on the data
