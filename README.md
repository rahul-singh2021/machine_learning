# machine_learning

Welcome to the Machine Learning Repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, algorithms, and resources to help you learn and implement various techniques in the field of machine learning.


Introduction
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of machine learning projects and resources to assist both beginners and experienced practitioners in learning and applying machine learning techniques.


Algorithms
The algorithms directory contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms. These implementations are provided as code snippets, Jupyter notebooks, or Python scripts, depending on the complexity and requirements of each algorithm. You can find implementations of popular algorithms such as:

Data Sets
To facilitate the learning and experimentation process, we have included a collection of sample data sets in the data-sets directory. These data sets cover various domains and can be used for training, testing, and evaluating machine learning models. Each data set is accompanied by a README file providing details about the data, its format, and potential applications.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to this repository! If you would like to contribute your own machine learning projects, algorithms, or data sets, please follow the guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file. We appreciate your contributions and the opportunity to learn from each other.


# 1:linear regression 

This repository contains code for predicting home prices based on the area of the house using linear regression. It utilizes the `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` libraries in Python.

## Dataset

The `homeprices.csv` file contains the dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model. It consists of two columns: "area" (the area of the house in square feet) and "price" (the corresponding price of the house in dollars).

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rahul-singh21/machine_learning.git

## homeprices.csv
    area,price
    2600,550000
    3000,565000
    3200,610000
    3600,680000
    4000,725000    
    

## Results

The script performs the following steps:

1. Loads the dataset from the `homeprices.csv` file.
2. Visualizes the data using a scatter plot.
3. Trains a linear regression model on the data

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from gradient_descent import gradient_descent

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11, 13])

gradient_descent(x, y)
The function will print the updated values of w (slope), b (y-intercept), and the current iteration number during the optimization process.

Parameters
The gradient_descent function has the following parameters:

x (NumPy array): Input data points (independent variable).
y (NumPy array): Output data points (dependent variable).
iterations (int): Number of iterations for the optimization process (default: 1000).
alpha (float): Learning rate for gradient descent (default: 0.001).
Feel free to modify the default values of iterations and alpha as per your requirements.

# 2:Linear Regression Multivariate
This program demonstrates multivariate linear regression using the scikit-learn library in Python. It predicts home prices based on the area, number of bedrooms, and age of the property. The dataset used for training and prediction is loaded from a CSV file named "homeprices.csv."
## Dependencies
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
- Ensure that the "homeprices.csv" file is in the same directory as the script.
- Modify the script if necessary to adapt to your dataset or analysis requirements.
- Run the script to perform multivariate linear regression and obtain price predictions.

## homeprices
area,bedrooms,age,price
2600,3,20,550000
3000,4,15,565000
3200,,18,610000
3600,3,30,595000
4000,5,8,760000
4100,6,8,810000


# 3:Gradient Descent 

This is an implementation of the gradient descent algorithm using numpy. It calculates the best-fit line for a given set of input data points.

## Usage

The `gradient_descent` function takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, representing the input data points and their corresponding target values.

```python
import numpy as np

def gradient_descent(x, y):
    # Function code here

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11, 13])

gradient_descent(x, y)
