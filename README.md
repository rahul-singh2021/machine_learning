# 1:linear regression 

This repository contains code for predicting home prices based on the area of the house using linear regression. It utilizes the `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` libraries in Python.

## Dataset

The `homeprices.csv` file contains the dataset used for training and testing the linear regression model. It consists of two columns: "area" (the area of the house in square feet) and "price" (the corresponding price of the house in dollars).

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rahul-singh21/machine_learning.git

## homeprices.csv
    area,price
    2600,550000
    3000,565000
    3200,610000
    3600,680000
    4000,725000    
    

## Results

The script performs the following steps:

1. Loads the dataset from the `homeprices.csv` file.
2. Visualizes the data using a scatter plot.
3. Trains a linear regression model on the data

## Dependencies
   To run this program, the following dependencies are required:

    pandas
    scikit-learn
    Install the dependencies using pip:
    pip install pandas scikit-learn

## Usage
    Clone the repository or download the insurance_data.csv file.

# 12:Handwritten Digit Classification
  This program uses logistic regression to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates how to load the dataset,     split it into training and testing sets, train a logistic regression model, and make predictions.

## Prerequisites
   To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

   Python 3
   Matplotlib
   Scikit-learn
   You can install the required packages by running the following command:

   pip install matplotlib scikit-learn
## Usage
   Clone the repository or download the program file.
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the program directory.
   Run the following command to execute the program:
   python digit_classification.py
   
## Program Description
   The program starts by importing the necessary libraries: matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.datasets.load_digits,                  sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split, and sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.

   The MNIST digit dataset is loaded using the load_digits function from sklearn.datasets. This dataset contains grayscale images of  handwritten digits and their corresponding labels.

   The grayscale plot is set using plt.gray().

   The program prints the labels of the first five digits using digits.target[0:5].

   The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection. The training set contains 80%  of the data, while the testing set contains 20%.

   An instance of logistic regression is created using LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model.

   The logistic regression model is trained using the training data and labels using the fit method.

   The model makes predictions on the first five digits in the dataset using model.predict(digits.data[0:5]).
